### MirrorVR is a Unity plugin that uses the [Epic Online Services transport](https://github.com/FakeByte/EpicOnlineTransport) with [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/) to create a easy, free, and beginner-friendly experience for multiplayer VR games.

### NOTE: This plugin will be in development for quite a bit. I am aiming to fine tune this as much as possible.
#### Check back later for more information.
